<p>Finally completed my new Twitter banner, starring my most frequently appearing members of my D&amp;D family!</p>

<p>(Working clockwise from left)</p>

<p>â˜˜Aske Koruban - dwarven Oath of the Ancients paladin. Strong and stoic like the oak, but fiery as the forge.</p>

<p>ğŸº Khoury - desert elf Circle of Twilight Druid, who apart from his strange ears and penchant for savory pastries, believes he can speak with the dead.</p>

<p>ğŸ Loyalty - promiscuous tiefling Warlock with some bardic flair, tied up in more ways than one with his patron, none other than the queen of the fae, Titania.</p>

<p>ğŸ€ Ratta - curmudgeonly forest gnome ranger who commands a whole troop of rats at her disposal. Also handy with a crossbow.</p>

<p>ğŸ¸ Frog-In-A-Jar - former outcast come Minecraft avatar turned full-on graffiti artist who can jump to the spots other taggers just canâ€™t reach.</p>

<p>ğŸ¦ Tin Whistle - kenku bard and former theatre troupe member. Likes shiny instruments. Can replicate full performances of Shakespeare and any popular song of the time upon first listen.</p>
