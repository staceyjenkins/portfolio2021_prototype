<p>My movie mashup poster for Critical Role is done! This is more a parody of the original UK poster painted by<a href="http://www.crispart.co.uk/Advertising/advertising.html">Steve Crisp</a> and a pretty big reference to the constant references in the show. My main fear with this is of course, referencing the poster without it being a complete rip-off, so this isnâ€™t an exact replicationâ€¦ more a good-humoured tribute to both. However, if fair-use copyright rears its ugly head, itâ€™ll no doubt be removed.</p>

<p>â€¦ and of course, Percy had to be Inigo. It was a no brainer.</p>
