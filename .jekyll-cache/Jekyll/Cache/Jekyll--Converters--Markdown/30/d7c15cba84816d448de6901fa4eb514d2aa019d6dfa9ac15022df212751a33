<p>Going through some bad brain time so doodled some comfort gnomes.</p>

<p>Also, a great opportunity to tweak their outfits and designs a little bit hence why this looks incredibly rough. Whenever Iâ€™ve doodled the gnomes in the past Iâ€™ve always felt Iâ€™d got their proportions wrong or Rattaâ€™s hair wrong. Therefore, this is kinda a good reference sheet for the gruesome twosome for the future.Â </p>

<p>Also Pinterâ€™s sleeves = &lt;3 The little renegade.</p>

<p>Also, Ratta is defying physics holding that crossbow with one hand, I swear.</p>
