Time to go the... S**t."&lt;/ficaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


My little animation experiment with Rumney. Now, Iâ€™m not studied in animation, so this is probably insanely rough and awkward in places, but I think I managed to get Rumneyâ€™s very sweet nature through in the actingâ€¦. (apart from the S-Bomb near the end! XD)
