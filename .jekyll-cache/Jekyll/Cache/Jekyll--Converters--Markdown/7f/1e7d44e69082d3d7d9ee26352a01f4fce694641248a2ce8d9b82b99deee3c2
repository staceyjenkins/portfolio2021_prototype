<p>..so I might be a nerd. A big one.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of designing custom MTG cards for my D&amp;D beastmaster ranger forest gnome Ratta Katcha and @dasacht’s Arcane Trickster rock gnome Pinter Spazzlespork.</p>

<p>It’s a little difficult to try and design these so that they don’t break the game! Here’s Pinter’s card, which is meant to indicate his love of books and a somewhat dark literary history. Pinter’s totally Dimir… or at least, supposedly.</p>
