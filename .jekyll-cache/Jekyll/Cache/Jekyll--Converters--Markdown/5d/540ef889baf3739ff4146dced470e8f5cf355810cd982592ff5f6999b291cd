<p>Thane, <a href="https://tmblr.co/mdhzzcAzF2ih8DLt2wscbbQ">@dasacht</a>â€™s fighter/Paladin multi-class character, is a man struggling with both the expectations of his nobility, but also the negative connotations of his ability to cast eldritch magic. As such, he appears on the Strength card in the Oakheart Rebellion tarot.</p>

<p>This card does what it says on the tin: it represents both strength of will and taming of the beast within. It indicates the ability to face adversity and oneâ€™s capability to face a challenge.</p>
