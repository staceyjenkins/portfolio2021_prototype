<p>â€œIâ€™ve never seen snow before,â€ chirped Khoury. â€œItâ€™s so pretty.â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s hell, is what it is,â€ snorted Loyalty, indignantly. â€œItâ€™s cold, itâ€™s wetâ€¦ Gets all in your hairâ€¦â€</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s not all bad,â€ Journey remarked, dusting some snow from his furred hood. â€œWhen it melts, we can see the flowers growing underneath. That means Spring is on the way.â€</p>

<p>Khoury pressed his nose against the glass eagerly. â€œI like snow.â€</p>
