Going through some bad brain time so doodled some comfort gnomes.

Also, a great opportunity to tweak their outfits and designs a little bit hence why this looks incredibly rough. Whenever I’ve doodled the gnomes in the past I’ve always felt I’d got their proportions wrong or Ratta’s hair wrong. Therefore, this is kinda a good reference sheet for the gruesome twosome for the future.&nbsp;

Also Pinter’s sleeves = \<3 The little renegade.

Also, Ratta is defying physics holding that crossbow with one hand, I swear.
