Well, who’s this handsome devil?

Tiefling, actually.

It’s a human Loyalty. This is actually his preferred form. Walking around with antlers gets a little awkward from time to time,

Wanted to doodle this as a quick study after watching a tutorial by the awesome Tyler Carter. I can say I learnt a lot!
