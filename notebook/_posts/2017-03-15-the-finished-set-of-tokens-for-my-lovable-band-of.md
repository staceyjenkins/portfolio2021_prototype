The finished set of tokens for my lovable band of misfits.

**Top row:**  
**Loyalty:** a sassy, flirty tiefling warlock with a rendezvous with Queen Titania in his past.

**Ratta:** A sullen forest gnome ranger who grew up in the sewers and a close relationship with the local rat population.

**Bottom row:**  
**Aske:** A dwarf paladin with a devotion to two gods: Moradin, the dwarven god of the Forge and Silvanus, the god of nature.

**Ratta:** A little lost magpie Kenku bard who instead of playing instruments, she repeats the sounds instead. She also repeats Shakespeare.
