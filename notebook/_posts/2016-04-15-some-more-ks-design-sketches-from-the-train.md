Some more K\_S design sketches from the train. Probably the only one of my characters who’s reckless enough to hold a lit match between his teeth(!). Not surprising then that he’s blind in his left eye with burns from previous hearings and acts of arson.

He’s pretty much a 1940s - 1950s teddy boy in terms of his styling and I can imagine him taking out a comb every now and again to make sure that hair’s in line.
