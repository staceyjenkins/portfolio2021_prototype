I had a plan for Coxcon, and then life happened.

Here are some finished paintings and concept sketches for some Coxcon postcards I unfortunately had to cancel.

Theyâ€™re each of the guests - Wowcrendor, Alex Faciane, Jesse Cox, Totalbiscuit, Jirard the Completionist and Mike from the Warp Zone as Overwatch characters!

These were far too much fun to do.
