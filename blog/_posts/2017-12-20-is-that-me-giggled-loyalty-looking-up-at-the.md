“Is that me?” giggled Loyalty, looking up at the screen excitedly.

“Yes, Lo.” I replied, “It is you. I draw you so often you end up looking different each time. I needed to make a reference for myself. Your freckles are missing though…”

“Ah, yes. Never mind that.” sighed Loyalty, “The mask. It does that sometimes.“
