<p>Curled up and scribbled a quick Rumney before bed. Still getting a hang of this sketchbook, which I have a sneaking suspicion is a notebook. Either way, this was inspired by a phrase on one of my friend’s Instagram feeds, which I’ve come to associate with the cuddly Rumney - “When we are put in a dark place, we presume we are buried. Actually, we are planted.” #telwythtaff #sketchbook #rumney #tumblr</p>
