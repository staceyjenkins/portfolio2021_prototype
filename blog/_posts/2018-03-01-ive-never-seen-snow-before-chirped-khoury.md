“I’ve never seen snow before,” chirped Khoury. “It’s so pretty.”

“It’s hell, is what it is,” snorted Loyalty, indignantly. “It’s cold, it’s wet… Gets all in your hair…”

“It’s not all bad,” Journey remarked, dusting some snow from his furred hood. “When it melts, we can see the flowers growing underneath. That means Spring is on the way.”

Khoury pressed his nose against the glass eagerly. “I like snow.”
