<p>“Is that me?” giggled Loyalty, looking up at the screen excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lo.” I replied, “It is you. I draw you so often you end up looking different each time. I needed to make a reference for myself. Your freckles are missing though…”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Never mind that.” sighed Loyalty, “The mask. It does that sometimes.“</p>
