Sometimes, the best partnerships spring out of nowhere. Ratta and Pinter - doubly so, if not a little smaller scale than usual.

Iâ€™m a little in love with these two, and I kinda wanted to see a colour image of the two of them. Hence this is a little practice painting, just to test a new workflow.

Pinter belongs to [@dasacht](https://tmblr.co/mdhzzcAzF2ih8DLt2wscbbQ).
