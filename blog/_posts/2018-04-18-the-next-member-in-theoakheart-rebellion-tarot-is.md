The next member in the Oakheart Rebellion tarot is the artificer, Zal, played by [@krauzer168](https://tmblr.co/mBekC8IRxJOyq4seXYo4Ayw). Naturally, he represents the Magician in the deck.

This card represents creation and the manifestation of ideas. It also represents action and the capacity of the individual.&nbsp;
