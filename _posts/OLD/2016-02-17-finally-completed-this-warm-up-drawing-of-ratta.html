<p>Finally completed this warm-up drawing of Ratta and Pinter I went a bit mad on. The anatomy’s a little off in places, but I really needed to draw them together in one image just for reference,</p>

<p>… and yes, Pinter has a little robotic bug…thing. He seems like the type who would make something like that, just because he can.</p>
