Now I can reveal what I’ve been working on since April!

I can officially announce I will be at [Coxcon 2017](https://www.coxcon.co.uk/) and I may be bringing some gifts with me. Expect to hear from me again when hopefully, I’ll have some postcards to give out at the event.

Be quick! I don’t think there’s very many tickets left!
