As you enter the Three Horseshoes Tavern, the smell of stale hops and the drunken roar slaps you unceremoniously across the face. You knew she was here - somewhere. This so-called ‘unconventional pest exterminator’. She was somewhere, curled up the shadows, mixing up her poisons. She was somewhere, probably with a dagger against someone’s throat.

And then you see her - a gnome, of a sort, with a sprout of red hair and stabbing green eyes, cooing and giggling with what appears to be a giant rat, stretched like a feather boa across her shoulders.

Yes. The rumours were indeed correct. This was no ordinary pest exterminator…
