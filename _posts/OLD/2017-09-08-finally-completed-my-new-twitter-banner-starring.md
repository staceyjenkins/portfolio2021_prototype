Finally completed my new Twitter banner, starring my most frequently appearing members of my D&D family!

(Working clockwise from left)

☘Aske Koruban - dwarven Oath of the Ancients paladin. Strong and stoic like the oak, but fiery as the forge.

🐺 Khoury - desert elf Circle of Twilight Druid, who apart from his strange ears and penchant for savory pastries, believes he can speak with the dead.

🍁 Loyalty - promiscuous tiefling Warlock with some bardic flair, tied up in more ways than one with his patron, none other than the queen of the fae, Titania.

🐀 Ratta - curmudgeonly forest gnome ranger who commands a whole troop of rats at her disposal. Also handy with a crossbow.

🐸 Frog-In-A-Jar - former outcast come Minecraft avatar turned full-on graffiti artist who can jump to the spots other taggers just can’t reach.

🐦 Tin Whistle - kenku bard and former theatre troupe member. Likes shiny instruments. Can replicate full performances of Shakespeare and any popular song of the time upon first listen.
